# HTML & CSS INTRODUCTION

## Introducion to HTML

**What is html?**
<p>HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is responsible for marking up the content of a website. It informs the user's computer about various elements on the page. Moreover, HTML grants access to a wide range of built-in browser functionalities that can be utilized by incorporating specific HTML code.
</p>
<p>
  The Web consists of three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
</p>
<p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is like the stylist of a web page. It is responsible for how everything looks â€” the colors, fonts, and sizes. It is also capable of adding cool animations and interactions to spice things up.
</p>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to create really cool and interactive stuff. When you have a fancy and complex interface on a website, chances are JavaScript is behind the scenes making it work smoothly for the users.

## HTML Text Formatting
<p>
  HTML is a language used to structure web pages. It uses tags, which are enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols, to mark different elements. Tags come in two types: opening tags and closing tags.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, an entire HTML document is basically a bunch of HTML elements nested inside each other. If you are familiar with computer science, you might recognize that this nesting creates a tree structure, like a family tree with parents, children, and siblings. 
Technically speaking, it is called a DOM tree, which stands for Document Object Model. The DOM tree becomes important when you are working with CSS or JavaScript.

<p>
  Let's discuss headlines. <br>
  The HTML elements used for marking up headlines come in six different types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. When viewed in a browser, each headline has a distinct visual effect. These elements also convey a sense of hierarchy in how the browser interprets and communicates about the page. 
  he h1 element is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest and least attention-grabbing.
